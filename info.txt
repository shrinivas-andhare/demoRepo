- Exception is an event that occurs during the execution due to wrong  :i
   input and it leads to abnormal termination of program execution. 
    
 - Whenever an exception is raised, JVM creates an object of type 
   of Exception or sub type of Exception and then returns the exception 
   related message to the console. 
    
 - Exception is a predefined class available in java. 
 - Exception is a sub class of Throwable. 
 - Throwable is the super-most class for each error and Exception and their 
   sub types. 
 - error is a predefined class. 
 - error has sub classes such as: 
       - Assertionerror 
       - ThreadDeath 
       - VirtualMachineerror 
       - Linkageerror 
   *Assertionerror thrown to indicate that an assertion has failed. 
   * It was introduced in java 1.4 version. 
  
  * ThreadDeath is thrown in the victim thread when the (deprecated) Thread.stop() 
    method is invoked.  
    -It was introduced in Java 1.0 version. 
    -An application should catch instances of this class only if it 
     must clean up after being terminated asynchronously.If 
     ThreadDeath is caught by a method, it is important that it should 
     be re-thrown so that the thread actually dies. 
      
  *VirtualMachineerror object is thrown to indicate that the Java Virtual Machine 
   is broken or has run out of resources necessary for it to continue operating. 
   - It has multiple sub classes: 
        a. Internalerror:  
           Its object thrown is to indicate some unexpected internal error that has occurred in the Java Virtual Machine. 
        b. StackOverflowerror: It is thrown when a stack overflow occurs because of an application recursing too deeply. 
        c. Unknownerror:Thrown when an unknown but serious exception has occurred in the Java Virtual Machine. 
        d.OutOfMemoryerror:It is thrown when the JVM cannot allocate an object because it is out of memory, and no more memory could be made available by the garbage collector. 
            
    * Linkageerror: Its  a subclass of error. 
          Its subclasses indicate that a class has some dependency on another class;however, the latter class incompatibly changed after the compilation of the former class. 
          It has sub classes such as: 
               a. ClassFormaterror 
               b. IncompatibleClassChangeerror 
               c. ClassCirculatoryerror 
               d. ExceptionInitializererror 
               e. Verifyerror 
               f. UnsatisfiedLinkerror 
               g. NoClassDefounderror 
         Some of the miscellaneous error as sub class of IncompatibleClassChangeerror are:NoSuchFielderror,NoSuchMethoderror,Instanitationerror, AbstractMethoderror etc. 
    Note:  
    NoSuchFielderror is thrown if an application tries to access or modify a specified 
    field of an object, and that object no longer has that field. 
    Generally, this error is caught by the compiler; this error can 
    only occur at run time if the definition of a class has 
    incompatibly changed. 
     
    NoSuchMethoderror: It is thrown if an application tries to call a specified method of a class (either static or instance), and that class no longer has a definition of 
    		       that method.Normally ,this error is caught by the compiler;this error can only occur at run time if the definition of a class has incompatibly changed. 
   
    IllegalAccesserror: It  is thrown if an application attempts to access or modify a field, or to call a method that it does not have access to. 
     
     
  ---Exception class in java: 
   - Exception is a predefined class available in java.lang package. 
   - It is the sub class of Throwable. 
   - Exception and its subclasses indicates conditions that are reasonable for an  
     application might to catch.
